# My CV

This is my personal CV, based on the [DojiCV template](https://github.com/sddevelopment-be/DojiCV) by [sddevelopment-be](https://github.com/sddevelopment-be). I have made some modifications to the original template to suit my needs.

## Using this template

This template is available on Overleaf at the following link: [DojiCV-overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/doji-cv-template/qgrgkscqndms)

You can use Overleaf to edit the template and generate the final PDF without the need for any additional software. However, you will need a LaTeX compiler to generate the PDF.

## Customizing the template

The template allows for several customization options, such as the color of the CV, the privacy toggle, the corner style, and the company header.

## Building the CV

To build the CV, simply hit the "Compile" button on Overleaf. The final PDF will be generated and ready to download.
